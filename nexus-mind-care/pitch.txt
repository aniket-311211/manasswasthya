  MANASSWASTHYA — 3-MINUTE PITCH
  Mental Wellness Platform for Indian College Students
================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------
OPENING HOOK (0:00 – 0:20)
----------------------------------------------------------------
"1 in 4 college students in India experiences significant mental
health challenges — yet fewer than 10% ever seek help. Why?
Because the system is inaccessible, expensive, and carries
stigma. We built ManasSwasthya to change that."

----------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS IT? (0:20 – 0:45)
----------------------------------------------------------------
"ManasSwasthya — meaning 'Mental Wellness' in Sanskrit — is an
AI-powered mental health companion designed specifically for
Indian college students. It's a full-stack web platform that
gives every student access to personalized mental health
support, anytime, anywhere, completely free and confidential."

----------------------------------------------------------------
THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE (0:45 – 1:00)
----------------------------------------------------------------
"Traditional mental health support has three barriers:

  • Cost — campus counselors are few and often unavailable.
  • Stigma — students fear judgment from peers or professors.
  • Awareness — most students don't even recognise they're
    struggling.

ManasSwasthya eliminates all three."

----------------------------------------------------------------
CORE FEATURES (1:00 – 1:45)
----------------------------------------------------------------
"The platform has four pillars:

ONE — AI Chat Companion.
Students can talk to Manas, our Gemini-powered AI, about
stress, anxiety, relationships, or exam pressure — 24/7, in a
judgment-free space. It detects crisis language in real time
and instantly shows emergency helplines like KIRAN and iCall.

TWO — Adaptive Mental Health Assessment.
Not a static questionnaire — our AI generates each next
question dynamically based on your previous answers, covering
six domains: academic, social, emotional, behavioral,
cognitive, and physical. It adapts like a real counselor would.

THREE — Community Support.
Students join anonymous group discussions, connect one-on-one
with peer mentors, and register for wellness events — all
within the platform.

FOUR — Mood Tracking & Medicine Analysis.
Students log daily moods; AI analyses patterns. They can also
photograph a medicine label and our AI identifies it, explains
side effects, and flags interactions."

----------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT MAKES IT STAND OUT (1:45 – 2:20)
----------------------------------------------------------------
"Three things set us apart:

FIRST — Real AI, not fake AI.
Every question in our assessment is generated live by Google
Gemini based on your unique response history. No other student
wellness app in India does this.

SECOND — Crisis-first design.
Mental health apps that ignore crisis risk are dangerous.
ManasSwasthya has multi-layer crisis detection — in chat, in
assessments, and in voice input — and always redirects to
verified Indian helplines.

THIRD — Built for India.
Culturally sensitive prompts, Indian emergency contacts, support
for regional context — we didn't just translate a Western app."

----------------------------------------------------------------
THE TECH (2:20 – 2:40)
----------------------------------------------------------------
"We built this on a modern, scalable stack: React and TypeScript
on the frontend, Node.js and Express on the backend, PostgreSQL
on Neon for persistent storage, Prisma as our ORM, Clerk for
secure authentication, and Google Gemini AI powering all our
intelligent features."

----------------------------------------------------------------
CLOSING (2:40 – 3:00)
----------------------------------------------------------------
"Mental health support shouldn't be a privilege. With
ManasSwasthya, every student — whether they're in a metro or a
tier-3 city — has a compassionate, intelligent companion in
their pocket. We're not replacing counselors. We're making sure
no student has to wait until it's too late. Thank you."
